    <h2 id="title">Elements And Structure</h2>
    <div id="structure"> 
        <h3>HTML Structure</h3>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to give content to a web page and instructs web browsers on how to structure that content. The content is split into sections and each element can have descendants (children) like a family tree. The descendants are spaced (or tabbed) to the right to make it easier to read the code.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <h3>HTML Content</h3>
        <p>The content of an HTML element is the information between the opening and closing tags of an element. <br>
        Note: Not all elements have a closing tag (img for example).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="lists">
        <h3>Lists</h3>
        <p>There are two types of lists:
            <ul>
                <li>Ordered lists using &lt;ol&gt; and are numbered as default.</li>
                <li>Unordered lists using &lt;ul&gt; and bullet pointed as default. </li>
            </ul>
            Both lists contant list item elements &lt;li&gt; to contain the content.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="video">
        <h3>Video Element</h3>
        <p>The element embeds a media player for video playback. The src attribute will contain the URL to the video. Adding the controls attribute will display video controls in the media player. <br><br>
            Note: The content inside the opening and closing tag is shown as a fallback in browsers that don't support the element.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="emphasis">
        <h3>Emphasis Element</h3>
        <p>The emphasis element emphasizes text and browsers will usually italicize the emphasized text by default.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="div">
        <h3>Div Element</h3>
        <p>The div element is used as a container that divides an HTML document into sections and is short for “division”. These elements can contain flow content such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.
